# Flight-Booking-System
The Flight Booking System is a system developed to be used in the Aviation Industry. The entire system is developed in Python language and MySQL RDBMS. Due to this, every process like displaying flight information or booking flights, or accessing facilities like booking hotels and ordering meals will take place at a fast pace.

This system can be used in two ways. An administrator can access all functions related to the working and proper management of the system. It includes adding new flight information like departure and arrival details, timings, Airline, and other important information. It also includes managing existing flights, updating any important information, or even deleting any flight record completely. Similarly, the management of information regarding hotels and meals is also possible and can be done by the administrator. A passenger can view flight information, book flights, hotels, and meals. There is also a security system built into the main system. Every user has to log in to the system with a correct password which first differentiates between a customer and an administrator and then provides relevant information for the relevant user.
